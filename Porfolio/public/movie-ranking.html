<h1>The Best Movies Acccording to Harilyn</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<p>I'm not really into movies. However, drawing from the ones I've seen, I think these three are the best. And if you haven't seen them, I really recommend that you do.</p>
<h3>Big Bang Theory</h3>
<p>This is my favorite sitcom. I could watch it an infinite number of times. I love the fact that among a group of nerds, there are people who could blend into their diverse ways of life and they all are happy together. This show cheers me up even on my most challenging days, and I can always count on its witty humour and fantastic characters to lighten my mood.</p>
<h3>Hunter X Hunter</h3>
<p>It's my favourite anime yet. It teaches me that you only stop chasing your dream after you've achived it. Never make a promise to yourself or anybody else if you're not willing to do anything it takes to keep it.</p>
<h3>The Great Pretender</h3>
<p>This is the first anime I watched, which marked the begining of my love affair with anime. From the very first scene, I was struck by the catchy tune and artistic visuals, and I became hooked instantly as the intricate plot began to unfold. Ever since, I became eager to explore more anime, and it became my go-to choice over other TV shows or movies - except Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon, Suits and Star Strek. You can call me a Nerd too...</p>
