  <title>About Me</title>

<body>
  <p>Hey there! I'm Harilyn, an aspiring full-stack web developer with a unique blend of introverted introspection and extroverted enthusiasm. In other words, I am an ambivert!
    For me, life is one big adventure waiting to unfold. I believe in the power of kindness, the magic of laughter, and the beauty of simple moments that make life extraordinary. I am a passionate explorer, curious learner, and a perpetual dreamer.
    </p>
  <p>The burning desire that I have now to become a programmer was absolutely influenced by a dear friend of mine. It all started with a casual discussion which led me to discovering my own passion for the subject. As my curiosity grew, my friend encouraged me to explore further - recommending books, online resources, and tutorials that I could use to deepen my understanding of IT. I have since become fascinated by the intricacies of the digital world, and my journey into web development is a testament to my passion for creating meaningful experiences on the internet.</p>
  <p>From designing eye-catching interfaces to crafting robust back-end solutions, I'm on a mission to master the art of web development.</p>
  
  <p>As an ambivert, I find joy in the best of both worlds. I cherish quiet moments of solitude where I can immerse myself in code, problem-solving, and learning new technologies, or generally reflecting on the daily triumph over the vissicitudes of life in our pursuit of true happiness, while I also find joy in connecting with others and learning from their experiences.
    It's this balanced nature that fuels my curiosity and keeps me open to new experiences, both in the tech world and beyond.</p>
  
  <p>Travel teaches as much as books! When I'm not immersed in the virtual realm of coding, you'll often find me exploring the tangible wonders of the world or my community through travel.
    There's something truly magical about stepping out of your comfort zone and venturing into new territories. I believe that travel is not just about visiting places, it's about immersing one's self in the local culture, connecting with people from different backgrounds, and broadening our perspectives, as every journey is an opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery. I cherish the memories and insights gained from each adventure.</p>
  
  <p>I'm a firm advocate of lifelong learning, always eager to challenge myself. Beyond coding, I occasionally indulge in anything that piques my interest at the moment, actually; from learning hard skills like sewing, or playing the guitar, to soft skills like comunication, and positive attitude. These skills allow me to express myself in unique ways, blending logic and creativity.</p>
  
  <p>Above all, I cherish the connections I make with people. I believe in the power of human connection and the ability to lift each other up. Every person has a unique story to tell, and I'm all ears to listen and understand. My friends often describe me as an empathetic listener and a reliable shoulder to lean on.</p>
